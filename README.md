## Description

Monitoring stack for XCP-ng hosts that runs a simple python script and scrapes the RRD stats to a prometheus instance. 
Run docker-compose up to start the stack after defining all the required information in the docker-compose file. Telegraf agent to export to influxdb can be configured as well.
